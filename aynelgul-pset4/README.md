This app serves as  a simple to-do list app that has a list of tasks that the user needs to 
complete.  If the user types text into a bottom input field and clicks an Add button, the
new item will be added to the top or bottom of the list. The user can 'check' and 'delete' 
these as well.

You can see screenshots in the docs group.
